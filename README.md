# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a **deep-learning neural network** using binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data Source:
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you received a [CSV](./Resources/charity_data.csv) containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.

## Results:
* Data Preprocessing
    * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
    * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary:
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
